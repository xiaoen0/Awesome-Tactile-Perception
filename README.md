## Data Collection
- **Active Exploration for Real-Time Haptic Training**<br>
[ICRA 2024] [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11776)]<br>
**Goal**: Focusing on only the most informative aspects of an object during data collection.<br>
**Method:** We demonstrate our `active learning approach` using `a biomimentic sensor`, exploring `“tactile scenes” composed of shapes, textures, and objects`.

### Fabric Tactile Sensation
- **Telextiles: End-to-end Remote Transmission of Fabric Tactile Sensation** <br>
[UIST 2023] [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03363)] <br>
**Goal:** remotely transmit tactile sensations of textiles. <br>
**Method:** we propose Telextiles, `an interface` that can remotely transmit tactile sensations of textiles by `creating a latent space` that reflects the proximity of textiles through `contrastive self-supervised learning`. <br>
**Essence:** Fabric Recognization.
